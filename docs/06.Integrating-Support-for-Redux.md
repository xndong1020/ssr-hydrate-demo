#### Integrating Support for Redux
4 big challenges
- Redux needs different configuration on browser vs server
- Aspects of authentication needs to be handled on server. Normally this is only on browser. (cookie or token are saved on client side)
- Need some way to detect when all initial data load action creators are completed on server 
- Need state rehydration on the browser

##### Solution to the first challenge:
1. We need to setup 2 instances of redux, one on the client, and one on the server.

**client state store**
client/src/_store/configureStore.ts

```ts
import ReduxThunk from 'redux-thunk'

import { createStore, applyMiddleware, combineReducers, compose } from 'redux'

import { usersReducer } from '../_reducers/usersReducer'
import { authReducer } from '../_reducers/authReducer'
import { loadingStatusReducer } from '../_reducers/loadingStatusReducer'

const rootReducer = combineReducers({
  auth: authReducer,
  users: usersReducer,
  loadingStatus: loadingStatusReducer
})

const composeEnhancers =
  (process.env.REACT_APP_DEPLOYMENT_STATE !== 'production' &&
    (window as Record<any, any>).__REDUX_DEVTOOLS_EXTENSION__ &&
    (window as Record<any, any>).__REDUX_DEVTOOLS_EXTENSION__()) ||
  compose

export const store = createStore(
  rootReducer,
  {},
  composeEnhancers(applyMiddleware(ReduxThunk))
)
export type RootState = ReturnType<typeof rootReducer>

```

**Caveat**:
In webpack 5 automatic node.js polyfills are removed. hence if you try to access the 'process' from front-end code, it will throw an error 'process is not defined'. 

Solution is to install 'yarn add -D process', then use  ProvidePlugin in webpack.client.js

webpack.client.js
```js
const webpack = require('webpack')
const path = require('path')
const { merge } = require('webpack-merge')
const common = require('./webpack.common')

config = {
  entry: './client/src/index.tsx',
  output: {
    filename: 'client.js',
    path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'public')
  },
  devtool: 'eval-source-map',
  // In webpack 5 automatic node.js polyfills are removed. hence you will get an error 'process is not defined'
  // solution is to install 'yarn add -D process', then use below ProvidePlugin to frontend
  plugins: [
    new webpack.ProvidePlugin({
      process: 'process/browser'
    }),
    new webpack.EnvironmentPlugin({
      DEPLOYMENT_STATE: 'development', // use 'development' unless process.env.DEPLOYMENT_STATE is defined
      API_BASE_URL: 'http://localhost:5000'
    })
  ]
}

module.exports = merge(common, config)

```


**server state store**

```ts
import ReduxThunk from 'redux-thunk'
import { createStore, applyMiddleware } from 'redux'
import { rootReducer } from '../../../shared/src/_reducers/rootReducer'

export default () => {
    const store = createStore(rootReducer, {}, applyMiddleware(ReduxThunk))
    return store
} 
```

then in the server/src/index.ts file

```ts
import express, { Request, Response } from 'express'

import configureStore from './_store/configureStore'
import renderer from './utils/renderer'

const app = express()

/**
 * open up the 'public' directory to the outside world, 
 * by telling Express.js to treat this public directory as a freely available public directory.
 */
app.use(express.static('public'))

app.get('/favicon.ico', (req, res) => res.status(204))

app.get('*', (req: Request, res: Response) => {
  const store = configureStore()
  res.send(renderer(req.url, store))
})

app.listen(3000, () => {
    console.log('server listening on port 3000')
})
```

Note: we create the store object in the route handler, then pass it down to the `renderer` util function

server/src/utils/renderer.tsx
```ts
import React from 'react'
import { AnyAction, Store } from 'redux'
import { Provider } from 'react-redux'
import { renderToString } from 'react-dom/server'
import { StaticRouter } from 'react-router-dom/server'
import Routes from '../../../shared/src/Routes'

export default (url: string, store: Store<any, AnyAction>): string => {
  /**
   * rather than mounting React components to some DOM node
     it renders all those components exactly one time
    converts the output of them to raw HTML, and returns it as a string
  */
  const content = renderToString(
    // StaticRouter doesn't have the access to the browser url, hence it must read the current path from req.url
    // for determining which component need to return to the user
    <Provider store={store}>
      <StaticRouter location={url}>
        <Routes />
      </StaticRouter>
    </Provider>
  )
  const html = `
      <html>
        <head>
          <title>Rendered from server</title>
        </head>
        <body>
          <div id="root">${content}</div>
          <!-- browser need to retrieve the client.js from the server, by looking from the Express.js static resources directory, which in our case is the 'public' directory-->
          <script src="client.js"></script>
        </body>
      </html>
    `
  return html
}

```

**shared reducers, action creators and  more**


shared/src/_reducers/usersReducer.ts
```ts

import { User } from '../models/User'
import { UserActionTypes } from '../_actions/userAction/actionTypes'

interface UserStateProps  {
    data?: User[] | undefined,
    error?: string | undefined
}

const initUserState: UserStateProps = {
  data: [],
  error: undefined
}

type FETCH_USER = {
    type: UserActionTypes.FETCH_USER
}

type FETCH_USER_SUCCESS = {
    type: UserActionTypes.FETCH_USER_SUCCESS,
    payload: User[]
}

type FETCH_USER_FAILED = {
    type: UserActionTypes.FETCH_USER_FAILED,
    payload: string
}

type FETCH_USER_ACTION_TYPE = FETCH_USER | FETCH_USER_SUCCESS | FETCH_USER_FAILED

export const usersReducer = (
  state = initUserState,
  action: FETCH_USER_ACTION_TYPE
): UserStateProps => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case UserActionTypes.FETCH_USER_SUCCESS:
      return { data: action.payload, error: undefined }
    case UserActionTypes.FETCH_USER_FAILED:
      return { data: undefined, error: action.payload }
    default:
      return state
  }
}
```

shared/src/_reducers/loadingStatusReducer.ts

```ts
import { LoadingStatusActionType } from "../_actions/loadingStatusAction/actionTypes"

interface LoadingStatusProps {
    isLoading: boolean
}

const initLoadingStatus: LoadingStatusProps = {
  isLoading: false
}

type SET_IS_LOADING_TRUE = {
    type: LoadingStatusActionType.SET_IS_LOADING_TRUE
}

type SET_IS_LOADING_FALSE = {
  type: LoadingStatusActionType.SET_IS_LOADING_FALSE
}

type LOAD_STATUS_TYPE = SET_IS_LOADING_TRUE | SET_IS_LOADING_FALSE

export const loadingStatusReducer = (
  initState = initLoadingStatus,
  action: LOAD_STATUS_TYPE
): LoadingStatusProps => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case LoadingStatusActionType.SET_IS_LOADING_TRUE:
      return { isLoading: true }
    case LoadingStatusActionType.SET_IS_LOADING_FALSE:
      return { isLoading: false }
    default:
      return initState
  }
}
```

We combined these reducers into rootReducer

```ts
import { createStore, applyMiddleware, combineReducers } from 'redux'

import { usersReducer } from './usersReducer'
import { authReducer } from './authReducer'
import { loadingStatusReducer } from './loadingStatusReducer'

export const rootReducer = combineReducers({
  auth: authReducer,
  users: usersReducer,
  loadingStatus: loadingStatusReducer
})

export type RootState = ReturnType<typeof rootReducer>
```

##### How to detect that date loading has been completed during the server side rendering process
1. How data loading on the server right now:
![data-loading-on-client-side](./docs/imgs/data-loading-on-client-side.png)

2. However, on the server, when the server receives a request, it take our redux store(with default init state), and use it to render the html string, and instantly send it back to the user's browser. There is no time allowed for completing the data loading. There is no time for the reducer the get the list of users and there's no time to allow the app to re-render itself with the new list of users.

Also, the 'componentDidMount' life cycle event is not even being invoked on the server! :scream:

3. ==Possible solution 1== to this issue:
In the renderer, after the initial store loaded with default init state, wait for all action creator requests to complete, then use the renderer to render a second time. At this point, 'store' has all of the data in it, then send it back to user's browser.

cons:
1. renders 2 times on the server, and re-rendering on the server is very computationally expensive.
2. only loads one round of requests. 

4. ==Possible solution 2==
Dispatch async action creator based on request url, and populate data into store, before send it back to the client.
