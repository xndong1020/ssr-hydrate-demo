#### StaticRouter for SSR

Solution: StaticRouter for server, and BrowserRouter for client

![routing](./imgs/routing-ssr.png)

<StaticRouter> is a <Router> that never changes location.

This can be useful in server-side rendering scenarios when the user isn’t actually clicking around, so the location never actually changes. Hence, the name: static. It’s also useful in simple tests when you just need to plug in a location and make assertions on the render output.

Reference: [<StaticRouter>](https://v5.reactrouter.com/web/api/StaticRouter)

Step 1: Create a shared 'Routes' component, which will be shared by client and server code

shared/src/Routes.tsx

```tsx
import React, { Suspense } from "react";
import { Routes, Route } from 'react-router-dom'
import Home from '../../client/src/components/Home'
import { Loading } from '../../client/src/components/Loading'

// const HomePage = React.lazy(() => import('../../client/src/components/Home')); // Lazy-loaded

// ReactDOMServer does not yet support Suspense (and lazy)
// export default () => {
//     return (
//       <Suspense fallback={<Loading />}>
//         <Routes>
//           <Route path="/" element={<HomePage />} />
//           <Route path="/hi" element={<div>Hi</div>} />
//         </Routes>
//       </Suspense>
//     )
// }

export default () => {
    return (
      <Routes>
        <Route path="/" element={<Home />} />
        <Route path="/hi" element={<div>Hi</div>} />
      </Routes>
    )
}
```
**Note**: ReactDOMServer does not yet support Suspense (and lazy)

Step 2: Modify client side code, add `BrowserRouter`

client/src/index.tsx

```js
import React from 'react'
import ReactDom from 'react-dom'
import { BrowserRouter } from 'react-router-dom'

import Routes from '../../shared/src/Routes'

ReactDom.hydrate(
  <BrowserRouter>
    <Routes />
  </BrowserRouter>,
  document.getElementById('root')
)
```


Step 3: Modify server side code, add `StaticRouter`

server/src/utils/renderer.tsx

```tsx
import React from 'react'
import { renderToString } from 'react-dom/server'
import { StaticRouter } from 'react-router-dom/server'
import Routes from '../../../shared/src/Routes'

export default (url: string): string => {
  /**
     * rather than mounting React components to some DOM node
         it renders all those components exactly one time
        converts the output of them to raw HTML, and returns it as a string
        */
  const content = renderToString(
    // StaticRouter doesn't have the access to the browser url, hence it must read the current path from req.url
    // for determining which component need to return to the user
    <StaticRouter location={url}>
      <Routes />
    </StaticRouter>
  )
  const html = `
      <html>
        <head>
          <title>Rendered from server</title>
        </head>
        <body>
          <div id="root">${content}</div>
          <!-- browser need to retrieve the client.js from the server, by looking from the Express.js static resources directory, which in our case is the 'public' directory-->
          <script src="client.js"></script>
        </body>
      </html>
    `
  return html
}

```

And change the `server/src/index.ts`

```ts
import express, { Request, Response } from 'express'

import renderer from './utils/renderer'

const app = express()

/**
 * open up the 'public' directory to the outside world, 
 * by telling Express.js to treat this public directory as a freely available public directory.
 */
app.use(express.static('public'))

app.get('/', (req: Request, res: Response) => {
  res.send(renderer(req.url))
})

app.listen(3000, () => {
    console.log('server listening on port 3000')
})


```

Step 4: Now the server `index.ts` only has 1 route handler, which is '/'. We need to add a catch all route '*', so any route request will be handled by `shared/Routes`, which returns a React component that can be renderAsHtmlString, and return back to user's browser.


```ts
import express, { Request, Response } from 'express'

import renderer from './utils/renderer'

const app = express()

/**
 * open up the 'public' directory to the outside world, 
 * by telling Express.js to treat this public directory as a freely available public directory.
 */
app.use(express.static('public'))

app.get('/favicon.ico', (req, res) => res.status(204))

app.get('*', (req: Request, res: Response) => {
  res.send(renderer(req.url))
})

app.listen(3000, () => {
    console.log('server listening on port 3000')
})

```

Now the SSR has 2 routes, '/' -> Home component, and '/hi' -> <div>Hi</div>
